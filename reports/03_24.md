### Leximin allocation on the full data set

Each leximin can be determined with a binary search for the smallest cost that allows a feasible allocation, but
faster computation can be done by leaving the optimization of a leximin to the LP solver.

(Extra note: Gurobi's tolerance for objective optimization and constraints is `1e-4`, so the values in the data set were multiplied by `1e9` and rounded before being put through the LP solver.)

Efficient allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1129.065`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3627.047`

Leximin allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1169.777`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3667.758`
