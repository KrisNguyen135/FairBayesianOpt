### Leximin allocation on the full data set

Each leximin can be determined with a binary search for the smallest cost that allows a feasible allocation, but
faster computation can be done by leaving the optimization of a leximin to the LP solver.

(Extra note: Gurobi's tolerance for objective optimization and constraints is `1e-4`, so the values in the data set were multiplied by `1e9` and rounded before being put through the LP solver.)

Efficient allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1129.065`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3627.047`

Leximin allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1169.777`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3667.758`

### When the number of unique resources is less than `n`

To illustrate the `n-1` upper-bound for `PoF(Leximin)`, we use the following cost matrix:

|     |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n-1 |  n  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|__1__|  0  |  1  |  1  | ... |  1  |  1  |
|__2__|  0  | 1-e |  1  | ... |  1  |  1  |
|__3__|  0  |  0  | 1-e | ... |  1  |  1  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
|__n-1__|  0  |  0  |  0  | ... | 1-e |  1  |
|__n__|  0  |  0  |  0  | ... |  0  | 1-e |

This table requires that we have `n` unique resources, which might not be the case in many situations.

To generalize, assume we have `m` unique types of resources, each of which has a capacity constraint. We denote the positive integer `c_j` to be the capacity for resource `j`, and we have `c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m = n`.

Using the same argument to prove that there exists at least one agent with cost `0` in a leximin allocation, we can prove that with the current model, there exist at least `min c_j` agents with cost `0`.
