### Agenda
- Tighter upper-bound for `PoF(Leximin)` with _repeated_ resources
- Computing the leximin allocation on the real data set
- More on the real data set
- Asymptotic costs in the random assignment problem

### Upper-bound for `PoF` when the number of unique resources is less than `n`

To illustrate the `n-1` upper-bound for `PoF(Leximin)`, we use the following cost matrix:

|     |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n-1 |  n  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|__1__|  0  |  1  |  1  | ... |  1  |  1  |
|__2__|  0  | 1-e |  1  | ... |  1  |  1  |
|__3__|  0  |  0  | 1-e | ... |  1  |  1  |
|__...__| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
|__n-1__|  0  |  0  |  0  | ... | 1-e |  1  |
|__n__|  0  |  0  |  0  | ... |  0  | 1-e |

This table requires that we have `n` unique resources, which might not be the case in many situations. To generalize, assume we have `m` unique types of resources, each of which has a capacity constraint. We denote the positive integer `c_j` to be the capacity for resource `j`, and we have `c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m = n`.

Using the same argument to prove that there exists at least one agent with cost `0` in a leximin allocation, we can prove that in any given group of `m` agents, each of whom is assigned to a unique resource out of `m` available resources, there always exists an agent with cost `0`.

Otherwise, we can construct a directed graph with vertices `1`, `2`, ..., `m` where an edge going from vertex `i` to `j` exists if and only if the `i`-th agent in this group of `m` agents will have a lower cost than under the leximin allocation if assigned to resource `j`. Each vertex will have at least one outgoing edge (since each agent is not being assigned to their best resource with cost `0` under leximin), resulting in a directed cycle. We can then obtain a more Pareto-optimal allocation by following a _switch_ in this graph, resulting in no agent having higher cost and at least one agent having lower cost. This is a contradiction with the fact that the allocation is leximin.

There are `min c_j` mutually exclusive groups of `m` agents as described above, so we conclude that there are at least `min c_j` agents with cost `0`. This will lead to the inequality that `PoF(Leximin) <= n - min c_j`.

### Leximin allocation on the full data set

Each leximin can be determined with a binary search for the smallest cost that allows a feasible allocation, but
faster computation can be done by leaving the optimization of a leximin to the LP solver.

(Extra note: Gurobi's tolerance for objective optimization and constraints is `1e-4`, so the values in the data set were multiplied by `1e9` and rounded before being put through the LP solver.)

Efficient allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1129.065`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3627.047`

Leximin allocation:
- Total cost increase: <br/>
`1169.777`
- Total cost: <br/>
`3667.758`

The below visualization compares the distribution of costs (probability increases) under the two allocations:

### Costs in the real data set

The following histogram denotes the distribution of probability increases in the real data set:

Applying KDE with different kernels results in the following estimations:

__Note:__ Support for negative values needs to be cut off (maybe using data mirroring).

However, individual values might not be i.i.d. from a common distribution. Individual columns, representing the usefulness of individual interventions, have different distributions from the overall distribution:

Values in a column might also be highly correlated with those in another column. The following is the correlation matrix of the costs (probability increases) among the five interventions:
